<br>
I am university professor for Computer Science in the Faculty of Applied Computer Science at the University of Augsburg, Germany, where I lead the [Intelligent Perception in Technical Systems group](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/en/fakultaet/fai/informatik/prof/ips/).

Prior to this position, I have been leader of the independent [Max Planck research group for Embodied Vision](https://is.mpg.de/ev/) funded by Cyber Valley at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tuebingen (2018-2024). I have been postdoctoral researcher at Computer Vision Groups at RWTH Aachen University and TU Munich. I received my PhD from University of Bonn. For my theses, I have been awarded with the prestigious Georges Giralt Award by euRobotics aibsl.

## Research Interests

* Robotics
* Computer Vision
* Machine Learning
* Deep Learning
* 3D Scene Understanding
* World Models
* Sensor Fusion
* Uncertainty Awareness and Interpretability

I am passionate about researching intelligent robots that perform complex tasks in everyday environments. My research centers around scene understanding and representation learning for robotics. With my research group, I pursue approaches for 3D object perception and learning world models, i.e., action-conditional forward models, for robot perception, planning, and control.
