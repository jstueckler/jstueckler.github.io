## Current Courses

At University of Augsburg, I offer courses on 3D computer vision, robot perception and learning, and foundations of machine learning in various study programmes such as Computer Science, Computer Science in Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, and Data Science.

### Summer term
* **Probabilistic Machine Learning** (4L+2E, MSc). This courses teaches fundamentals in probabilistic machine learning methods that quantify uncertainty in inputs, learned models, and predictions.
* **Embodied Artificial Intelligence** (2L+4E, MSc). This course consists of lectures and team project exercises in robot perception and learning.

### Winter term
* **Foundations of Autonomous Mobile Robotics** (2L+2E, BSc). In this course, we teach fundamentals of modeling, localization, mapping, and autonomous navigation for mobile robots.
* **Computer Vision for Intelligent Systems** (2L+2E, MSc). This course covers basics and modern approaches of 3D computer vision.
* **Seminars on Embodied Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision** (2 weekly hours, BSc). In the seminars, we teach how to read scientific papers and how to give scientific talks and write scientific reports.

## Past Teaching

I have been lecturing on robot vision and 3D computer vision in the past. I also offered lab courses on vision-based navigation. During my PhD studies I have been teaching assistant for lab courses and seminars on cognitive robotics, mobile manipulation, and autonomous robotics.
